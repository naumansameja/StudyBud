This is a Discord clone.
Users can Create rooms based on a specific topic and interact with each other.
Users can log in using either their username or email.
Each Room has a host who can delete any message from that room or delete the entire room.
When a user signs up, a confirmation mail is sent to him. Until he verifies his identity, his account remains inactive.
If a user forgets his password, he can recover his password by email confirmation.
